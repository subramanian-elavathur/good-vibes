# good-vibes

Good Vibes is a simple Node.js testing library designed to make writing tests easy and fun.

It was inspired by, and written while listening to, [Alicia Keys' Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwUt1fVLb3E)

## Usage Instructions

Usage is described in files inside `test` folder

- Simple tests can be found in [test/simple.test.js](./test/simple.test.js)
- Test grouping with use of `before` and `after` can be found in [test/groups.test.js](./test/groups.test.js)
- A concise example of groups using the `group` api can be found in [test/concise-groups.test.js](./test/concise-groups.test.js)
- Examples of failing tests can be found in [test/failing.test.js](./test/failing.test.js)

## Important Note
