# good-vibes

Good Vibes is a simple Node.js testing library designed to make writing tests easy and fun.

It was inspired by, and written while listening to, [Alicia Keys' Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwUt1fVLb3E)

## Important Note

Hi there, thanks for checking out good-vibes. Until we reach `v1.0.0` the api might change in a breaking manner - but we hope to reach `v1.0.0` fairly quickly
